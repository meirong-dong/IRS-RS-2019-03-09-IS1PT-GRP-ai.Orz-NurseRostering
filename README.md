## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
An important aspect of hospital operations in Singapore is the effective scheduling of nurses in various wards, which is vital for the hospitals’ patients to receive timely care from the nurses with the necessary skill sets. The objective is to balance operational costs and safe patient care needs while maximizing the degree to which nurses’ request are met.

However, the scheduling of the nurses’ roster is very time-consuming and challenging due to the need to balance the intensive demands of healthcare and the well-being of nurses. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of the workload and unforeseen circumstances, rescheduling is also very common.

Our project focuses on taking the chore out of the painstaking process of scheduling with the objective of reducing the time taken to achieve the best possible schedule in a highly repeatable manner.


Our team: ai.Orz: comprising of 6 members: Dai Yirui, Dong Meirong, Gu Lijian, Guo Feng, Wong Yoke Keong, Zhang Le are from different areas including financial services, healthcare, cloud, software engineering. We hope to deliver a widely used platform which can bring core-value to hospitals, helping hospitals to do digital transformation, improve efficiencies, lower operational costs and integrate solution with enterprises' existing systems.
